# 🏥 HealthTrack Lite — Patient Monitoring System

**HealthTrack Lite** is a simulated patient monitoring web application designed for demonstrating a real-world **hardware-integrated healthcare project**.

> 💡 This is actually a **hardware project**, but since we are currently in the prototyping stage, vitals and responses are **simulated in software**. The live web demo reflects this simulation.
